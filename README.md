# quantitative_trade

This repository contains slides and codes for Quantitative International Economics, taught at University of Notre Dame, Spring 2025. I will be adding the slides and codes here in this repository over the semester.

The tentative outline of the course is:

- Basic Foundations of Quantitative Trade Models
  - Introduction
  - CES and Gravity
  - Model inversion, trade cost estimation, trade elasticity estimation
- Firms
  - Krugman, Melitz, and Chaney
  - Multinational
- Economic Geography
  - Commuting and labor mobility
  - Agglomeration versus congestion
  - Migration
- Trade and development
  - Non-homothetic preferences, technology, and structural change
  - Heterogeneous factors of production (land and labor)
- Dynamic models
  - Myopic agents (no anticipation)
  - Forward looking (with anticipation)
  
This course benefits from lecture notes and syllabi from several trade economists, some of which are publicly available, including Farid Farrokhi, Ahmad Lashkaripour, Treb Allen, Costas Arkolakis, Sebastian Sotelo, Natalia Ramondo, Dave Donaldson, Arnaud Costinot, Rob Johnson, Rafael Dix-Carneiro, and Thomas Chaney.
